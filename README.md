# DIYIOT
Open source IOT hardware and software platform based on cheap commodity sensors, ESP8266-12e chips, the MQTT protocol and powered by IBM's Node-Red.

The goal of the project is to put sensors (and actuators like servos or leds) online as inexpensively as possible, ideally for under $7 or 8 per device. 

See DIY Board and Sensor Pin Map to figure out what board to use for which sensor, also see notes.

If you find a cheap commodity sensor that works great with an exisiting board - let us know so we can add it to the list.

If there is a problem with a sensor firmware code, or pin map, let us know or share a fix.

Thanks, 

the DIYIOT team
